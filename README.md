OWASP-aware-zone
================
It's been done many times before, but I just had to do it myself. The goal of this project is to provide a variety of simple webapps that demonstrate classic webapp vulnerabilities in order to increase knowledge and awareness. Many, if not all of the vulnerabilities are listed on the OWASP Top 10. While most of these pitfalls can be avoided simply by making use of modern web frameworks and their built-in protections, it is still important to understand how these vulnerabilities work and how their exploitation can be prevented.

The basic requirements for this webapp are nginx/Apache and PHP. Many of the demos use .txt files to store things. Permissions will need to be set such that the webserver can read and write to these files.
